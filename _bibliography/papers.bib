  abstract = {Wearables are widely used for health data collection due to their availability and advanced sensors, enabling smart health applications like stress detection. However, the sensitivity of personal health data raises significant privacy concerns. While user de-identification by removing direct identifiers such as names and addresses is commonly employed to protect privacy, the data itself can still be exploited to re-identify individuals. We introduce a novel framework for similarity-based Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) re-identification attacks on time series health data. Using the WESAD dataset  and two larger synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that even short segments of sensor data can achieve perfect re-identification with our Slicing-DTW-Attack. Our attack is independent of training data and computes similarity rankings in about 2 minutes for 10,000 subjects on a single CPU core. These findings highlight that de-identification alone is insufficient to protect privacy. As a defense, we show that adding random noise to the signals significantly reduces re-identification risk while only moderately affecting usability in stress detection tasks, offering a promising approach to balancing privacy and utility.},

  abstract = {With growing concerns about user data collection, individualized privacy has emerged as a promising solution to balance protection and utility by accounting for diverse user privacy preferences. Instead of enforcing a uniform level of anonymization for all users, this approach allows individuals to choose privacy settings that align with their comfort levels. Building on this idea, we propose an adapted method for enabling Individualized Differential Privacy (IDP) in Federated Learning (FL) by handling clients according to their personal privacy preferences. By extending the SAMPLE algorithm from centralized settings to FL, we calculate client-specific sampling rates based on their heterogeneous privacy budgets and integrate them into a modified IDP-FedAvg algorithm. We test this method under realistic privacy distributions and multiple datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves clear improvements over uniform DP baselines, reducing the trade-off between privacy and utility. Compared to the alternative SCALE method in related work, which assigns differing noise scales to clients, our method performs notably better. However, challenges remain for complex tasks with non-i.i.d. data, primarily stemming from the constraints of the decentralized setting.},

  abstract = {Machine Learning (ML) is crucial in many sectors, including computer vision. However, ML models trained on sensitive data face security challenges, as they can be attacked and leak information. Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning (PPML) addresses this by using Differential Privacy (DP) to balance utility and privacy. This study identifies image dataset characteristics that affect the utility and vulnerability of private and non-private Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models. Through analyzing multiple datasets and privacy budgets, we find that imbalanced datasets increase vulnerability in minority classes, but DP mitigates this issue. Datasets with fewer classes improve both model utility and privacy, while high entropy or low Fisher Discriminant Ratio (FDR) datasets deteriorate the utility-privacy trade-off. These insights offer valuable guidance for practitioners and researchers in estimating and optimizing the utility-privacy trade-off in image datasets, helping to inform data and privacy modifications for better outcomes based on dataset characteristics.},

  abstract = {In contrast to privacy attacks focussing on individuals in a training dataset (e.g., membership inference), Property Inference Attacks (PIAs) are aimed at extracting population-level properties from trained Machine Learning (ML) models. These sensitive properties are often based on ratios, such as the ratio of male to female records in a dataset. If a company has trained an ML model on customer data, a PIA could for example reveal the demographics of their customer base to a competitor, compromising a potential trade secret. For ratio-based properties, inferring over a continuous range using regression is more natural than classification. We therefore extend previous white-box and black-box attacks by modelling property inference as a regression problem. For the black-box attack we further reduce prior assumptions by using an arbitrary attack dataset, independent from a target model's training data. We conduct experiments on three datasets for both white-box and black-box scenarios, indicating promising adversary performances in each scenario with a test R{$^2$} between 0.6 and 0.86. We then present a new defense mechanism based on adversarial training that successfully inhibits our black-box attacks. This mechanism proves to be effective in reducing the adversary's R{$^2$} from 0.63 to 0.07 and induces practically no utility loss, with the accuracy of target models dropping by no more than 0.2 percentage points.},

Our method not only protects patient information but also enhances data availability for research. To ensure its usefulness, we test synthetic data from multiple GANs and employ different data enhancement strategies on an actual stress detection task. Our GAN-based augmentation methods demonstrate significant improvements in model performance, with private DP training scenarios observing an 11.90{\textendash}15.48\% increase in F1-score, while non-private training scenarios still see a 0.45\% boost. These results underline the potential of differentially private synthetic data in optimizing utility{\textendash}privacy trade-offs, especially with the limited availability of real training samples. Through rigorous quality assessments, we confirm the integrity and plausibility of our synthetic data, which, however, are significantly impacted when increasing privacy requirements.},

  abstract = {Machine learning (ML) can help fight pandemics like COVID-19 by enabling rapid screening of large volumes of images. To perform data analysis while maintaining patient privacy, we create ML models that satisfy Differential Privacy (DP). Previous works exploring private COVID-19 models are in part based on small datasets, provide weaker or unclear privacy guarantees, and do not investigate practical privacy. We suggest improvements to address these open gaps. We account for inherent class imbalances and evaluate the utility-privacy trade-off more extensively and over stricter privacy budgets. Our evaluation is supported by empirically estimating practical privacy through black-box Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs). The introduced DP should help limit leakage threats posed by MIAs, and our practical analysis is the first to test this hypothesis on the COVID-19 classification task. Our results indicate that needed privacy levels might differ based on the task-dependent practical threat from MIAs. The results further suggest that with increasing DP guarantees, empirical privacy leakage only improves marginally, and DP therefore appears to have a limited impact on practical MIA defense. Our findings identify possibilities for better utility-privacy trade-offs, and we believe that empirical attack-specific privacy estimation can play a vital role in tuning for practical privacy.},

  abstract = {Chest X-rays enable a fast and safe diagnosis of COVID-19 in patients. Applying Machine Learning (ML) methods can support medical professionals by classifying large numbers of images. However, the amount of data needed for training such classifiers poses problems due to clinical data privacy regulations, which present strict limitations on data sharing between hospitals. Specifically, the models resulting from ML are vulnerable to attacks and can compromise data integrity by leaking details about their training data. Privacy-Preserving ML (PPML) offers methods to create private models that satisfy Differential Privacy (DP), enabling the development of medical applications while maintaining patient privacy.
  
  This work aims at investigating the privacy-preserving detection of COVID-19 in X-ray images. The PPML training methods DP-SGD and PATE are matched against non-private training. The private models should mitigate the data leakage threats posed by Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs). However, the inclusion of DP showed no improvements in MIA defense on the COVID-19 detection task. Instead, the non-private models presented the same repelling properties as the private models. Thus, if only the defense against MIAs is of concern, the non-private approach achieving 97.6\% classification accuracy is the best choice. Private DP-SGD training for \textbackslash varepsilon = 1 is a more sensible alternative when a theoretical privacy guarantee is needed. The best DP-SGD model reaches 74.1\% accuracy. Even though the accuracy-privacy trade-off of 23.5\% is significant, the private model performs 0.3\% better than related work and keeps much tighter privacy guarantees. Ultimately, the conflicting findings from the additional experiments on the MNIST database, where DP significantly increased MIA defense, indicate that PPML (or DP-SGD) is heavily task-dependent. Thus, research on one dataset might not carry over to others.},
