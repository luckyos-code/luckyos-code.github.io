  abstract = {We present the first privacy-preserving approach for stress detection from wrist-worn wearables based on the Time-Series Classification Transformer (TSCT) architecture and incorporating Differential Privacy (DP) to ensure provable privacy guarantees. The non-private baseline results prove the TSCT to be an effective model for the given task. Our DP experiments then show that the private models suffer from reduced utility but can still be used for reliable stress detection depending on the application. Our proposed approach has potential applications in smart health, where it can be used to monitor smartwatch users' stress levels without compromising their privacy and provide timely interventions or suggestions to prevent adverse health outcomes. Another primary contribution is our evaluation, which studies and shows negative effects of DP regarding model training. The results of this work provide perspectives for future research and applications whenever the fields of stress detection and data privacy intervene.},

Our results indicate that needed privacy levels might differ based on the task-dependent practical threat from MIAs. The results further suggest that with increasing DP guarantees, empirical privacy leakage only improves marginally, and DP therefore appears to have a limited impact on practical MIA defense. Our findings identify possibilities for better utility-privacy trade-offs, and we believe that empirical attack-specific privacy estimation can play a vital role in tuning for practical privacy.},

By utilizing a word embedding model we create document embeddings for all queries and arguments. These are compared with each other to calculate top-N argument context scores for each query. We also calculate top-N DPH scores with the Terrier Framework. This way, each query receives two lists of top-N arguments. Afterwards we form an intersection of both argument lists and sort the result by the DPH scores. To further increase the ranking quality, we sort the final arguments of each query by sentiment values. Our findings ultimately imply that rewarding neutral sentiments can decrease the quality of the retrieval outcome.},

  abstract = {Chest X-rays enable a fast and safe diagnosis of COVID-19 in patients. Applying Machine Learning (ML) methods can support medical professionals by classifying large numbers of images. However, the amount of data needed for training such classifiers poses problems due to clinical data privacy regulations, which present strict limitations on data sharing between hospitals. Specifically, the models resulting from ML are vulnerable to attacks and can compromise data integrity by leaking details about their training data. Privacy-Preserving ML (PPML) offers methods to create private models that satisfy Differential Privacy (DP), enabling the development of medical applications while maintaining patient privacy.
  
  This work aims at investigating the privacy-preserving detection of COVID-19 in X-ray images. The PPML training methods DP-SGD and PATE are matched against non-private training. The private models should mitigate the data leakage threats posed by Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs). However, the inclusion of DP showed no improvements in MIA defense on the COVID-19 detection task. Instead, the non-private models presented the same repelling properties as the private models. Thus, if only the defense against MIAs is of concern, the non-private approach achieving 97.6\% classification accuracy is the best choice. Private DP-SGD training for \textbackslash varepsilon = 1 is a more sensible alternative when a theoretical privacy guarantee is needed. The best DP-SGD model reaches 74.1\% accuracy. Even though the accuracy-privacy trade-off of 23.5\% is significant, the private model performs 0.3\% better than related work and keeps much tighter privacy guarantees. Ultimately, the conflicting findings from the additional experiments on the MNIST database, where DP significantly increased MIA defense, indicate that PPML (or DP-SGD) is heavily task-dependent. Thus, research on one dataset might not carry over to others.},

The main components of this software can be used for managing and integrating datasets, exploring knowledge graphs as well as curating and authoring resources. Most of these functionalities can be adjusted to specific requirements by using the Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL). The main goal of this thesis is the specification and implementation of a visual editor for linked data knowledge graphs. Furthermore, this editor should be adjustable to specific domains by utilizing SHACL shape descriptions. Thus, users will be able to explore and edit their data in a graphical representation.},
